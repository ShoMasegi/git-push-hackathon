Git Push Hackathon is a remote hackathon event for students, hosted by CyberAgent, Inc. Once you apply, all you need to do is to push what you’ve written.

## How to apply?

In order to confirm that you are student, you must provide your email address provided from your school; We only accept applications from students.

Just fill out [the application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePYirFzO3yPYaCTm6BHum9rB_jpEhGe9fX5hVjhMdwilgCUg/viewform) and send it to us.

## What to do?

1. Apply to the hackathon by filling out the application above
2. Fork CyberAgent/git-push-hackathon repository
3. Inside a forked repository, make a directory with your GitHub account's name and develop an app that fulfills [the requirements](#requirements)
4. **After your development completes**, send a pull request to CyberAgent/git-push-hackathon repository. The pull request must contain the entire directory you made in step 3

**※Once you send a pull request, we start reviewing your source code.**  
**※We strongly recommend that you join the hackathon individually. You may choose to join the hackathon as a team, but in order to maintain a fair evaluation process, we are afraid that we won't be able to give any prize to apps made by teams**

## Requirements

Develop a GitHub client-side mobile application using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)s.

### Minimum requirements

- "Sign in" functionality using OAuth authentication
- Show a list of User's activity-events using [activity/events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/)

as "Sample" Gifs below show.

### Note

If your application requires some dependencies to be resolved, 

- Create README inside your own repository, and
- Write down step-by-step, clear explanation how to solve those dependencies

When we evaluate your application and source code, we will take a look at your README and resolve any dependency according to your README. Therefore, any package or module generated for resolving those dependencies does not have to be included inside your repository as long as we can resolve it. However, note that if we cannnot figure out how to build your project, **we may not be able to evaluate your project at all.**

You may need to generate any variable necessary when devleoping an application(e.g. Client ID, Client secret). When you send a pull request, you should NOT include the values of those credentials; instead you must claify where(e.g. File name) to put those credentials on your README. When we evaluate your application and source code, we will use ours so do not include those credentials when you make a pull request.
